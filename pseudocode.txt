Your suitcase of magical beasts:
I. Billywig (accio)- native to Austrailia: small, speedy insect that causes levitation and giddiness when they sting.
II. Bowtruckle (aparcium) - tree guardians found in the west of England, Southern Germany, and in some Scandinavian forests. Small in size, bowtruckles are mostly peaceful and shy and generally won’t attack with their sharp fingers unless their tree is threatened.
III. Niffler (alohomora) - Small, cuddly, and affectionate yet completely destructive, nifflers are usually kept by goblins to search for treasure. While they’re excellent at finding anything that sparkles and glitters, they can quickly cause havoc. 
IV. Erumpent (stupefy) - One of the more dangerous magical creatures on this list, erumpents are visually similar to a rhinoceros except they have an explosive horn on their heads. They’re native to Africa and are respected by African witches and wizards.
V. Obscurus (Petrificus Totalus)- a type of magical parasite that forms when a wizard or witch suppresses their magical ability. It looks like an ash-colored, tendril-equipped cloud and thrashes anything and everything in its path.
